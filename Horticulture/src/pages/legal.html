                    <p>Hi! Congratulations on being the sort of person who reads terms of use. We applaud you. Below, you'll see the terms and conditions (“Terms of Use”) to which you must agree if you're going to use any of SB Horticulture's services. Our lawyers wrote that, and that's the stuff that counts. We’ve also provided some plain language wording - how I’d explain it to someone that didn’t have the time to read and digest the whole thing. I hope it helps you make sense of this document, so that you can understand what you're consenting to. Thanks for joining the SB Horticulture community!</p>
