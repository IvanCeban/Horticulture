                <h3>What is the difference</h3>
                <p>The size of your garden is irrelevant. Each has its own environmental challenges and therefore selecting the correct plant that will thrive in your conditions is key to successful gardening.<br>
                    We are frequently told by our clients that “nothing will grow” or “we’ve tried several plants and all have died” when faced with ‘problem’ areas of the garden.<br><br>
                    We regularly hear phrases such as “we already have a gardener but they don’t demonstrate any plant knowledge ” or “we have recently had the garden landscaped but there are plants underperforming”. This is the key difference between a landscaper, a gardener and a horticulturist. There is a misconception that these are the same. They’re not.<br><br>
                    We provide three services to our clients. Each offering its own individual and tailored area of specialised garden care.
                </p>
                <h3>Garden Care</h3>
                <p>Maintaining a garden is an ever evolving experiment. Each week, month and season will bring pleasure and its own set of challenges.  Reading and understanding these is the recipe for having a garden that offers you an outdoor living space that is tranquil, relaxing but above all useable for your needs.</p>
                <h3>Plant Scheme Design</h3>
                <p>Whether we’re designing a whole garden planting scheme or just a border the key principles to success remain the same. Ultimately, your garden needs to fulfil your individual needs. We will take into account your gardens environmental conditions, budget, brief and end objectives to deliver a garden you can enjoy year round</p>
                <h3>Plant Rejuvenation</h3>
                <p>All plants need a certain level of care and attention but in varying amounts. You can’t apply the same pruning methods to all plant groups. Therefore, being able to read symptoms, understand and predict how a plant will respond to work is vital to successful plant management.</p>
