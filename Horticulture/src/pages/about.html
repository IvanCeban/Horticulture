                <h3>What is the difference</h3>
                <p>It doesn’t matter the size of your garden or the environmental challenges it may present, there is a plant that will thrive in the conditions you have!<br>
                    I am frequently told by my clients that “nothing will grow” or “we’ve tried several plants and all have died” when faced with ‘problem’ areas of the garden.<br><br>
                    Other regularly used phrases I hear are “we already have a gardener but we’re unsure what to plant” or “we have recently had the garden landscaped but there are plants that are not doing very well”. This is the key difference between a landscaper, a gardener and a horticulturist. There is a misconception that these are the same. They are not.<br><br>
                    I provide three horticultural services that will give you the garden that you have dreamed about.
                </p>
                <h3>Garden Care</h3>
                <p>Maintaining a garden is just as tough as it is getting it to the right level of beauty and harmony. We’ll take on that hard work so you don’t have to.</p>
                <h3>Plant Scheme Design</h3>
                <p>Designing creating a garden beautiful garden that gives you a sense of wonderment and joy all year round.</p>
                <h3>Plant Rejuvenation</h3>
                <p>An overgrown garden unless it’s a wild garden can ditract from it’s beauty. I will prune your garden so that each plany has enough space to thrive and show it’s real beauty.</p>
