                <p>“We were approached by the client on a recommendation of a neighbour for which we completed regular garden care. The new client had recently had built a modern, open planned, rear extension incorporating dinning and extended living space. Now that the construction work had been completed the extended property now looked out on areas of the rear garden which were originally not a priority or main focus. The brief was to create border that would have extended seasonal interest and be in keeping with the modern extension.</p>

            <div class="cell small-12 medium-6 large-4">
                <p>The preferred theme and style was Cottage and Mediterranean whilst using a cool colour palette including Greys, Blues and Purples as these were the main colours used in our clients wedding. Due to the proximity of the border to the property we recommended using a selection of both scented and culinary plants to add additional interest.”</p>
