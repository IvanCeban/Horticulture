                <p>“Similar in brief to phase 1, the client required a border mainly consisting of shrubs that would offer long periods of seasonal interest. The border originally consisted of a number of mature trees and shrubs that over time had either out grown their position or had their growth affected by being in close proximity to surrounding plants. Though a number of shrubs within the border would have complemented our new planting scheme they were either to mature to successfully transplant or beyond rejuvenation pruning.</p>

            <div class="cell small-12 medium-6 large-4">
                <p>We selectively chose and removed those plants that we felt could be easily replaced with similar specimens or simply weren’t right for the redesigned border. We recommended to the client to continue the already chosen theme of “semi woodland” and “natural” to ensure continuity of design and flow through the garden whilst using weed suppressant membrane and spruce bark mulch to reduce ongoing maintenance. Upon completion of the project we were asked to manage the maintenance going forward.”</p>
