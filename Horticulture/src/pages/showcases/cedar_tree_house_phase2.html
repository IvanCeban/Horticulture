                <p>“After successful completion of phase one we were invited back to work with the client again on the second phase of their garden improvement works. The site is located on a slope and this particular border on very steep banking. The brief was to create a semi woodland style scheme using predominantly shrubs that wouldn’t grow too large or were able to be seasonally pruned to keep them in shape so as not to detract from the view.</p>

            <div class="cell small-12 medium-6 large-4">
                <p>All the preparation work had to be undertaken by hand due the severity of the slope with a large mature Cedar tree casting a canopy over the area. Based on the ground and site conditions we agreed on a planting scheme that incorporated all aspects and still met the initial brief. Upon completion of phase two, we were awarded the ongoing care of the border.”</p>
