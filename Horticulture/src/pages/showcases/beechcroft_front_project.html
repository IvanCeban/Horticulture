                <p>"The client brief for this project was to recommend, design and plant a highly colourful display that would provide interest from mid spring through to early autumn. The border was located at the front of the property with half the border receiving early to late morning sun while the other half being positioned in the shade for the majority of the day. </p>

                <p>The client wanted to use predominately herbaceous planting in the knowledge that during the autumn and winter months there would be minimal interest and structure.</p>

            <div class="cell small-12 medium-6 large-4">
                <p>To meet the brief but to resolve the lack of winter interest we recommended the planting of evergreen climbers located at the rear of the border and ornamental grasses which would remain throughout the autumn and winter months."</p>
