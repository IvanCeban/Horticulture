                <p>“Our brief for this project was to inject extended periods of interest in a mature garden that would be viewed from the rear conservatory.  An emphases on using shrubs whilst being low maintenance was also important. We met with the client several times to discuss the best way of achieving their objective. We recommended that in order to maximise the potential of this border the removal of a number of mature trees would create opportunities that weren’t available to us in its current state. We worked closely with our tree surgeon and the client to undertake these works which later included the replacement of a boundary fence.</p>

                <p>Our planting scheme needed to work with the remaining mature trees and shrubs so a “semi woodland” and “natural” scheme was agreed. Due to the scale of the border, and the effect required, we used mature planting which included climbers on the new fence to further add to the interest and give a perception of depth to the border. Weed suppressant matting was used with a spruce bark mulch to reduce ongoing maintenance for which we were asked to complete for the client going forward.”</p>
