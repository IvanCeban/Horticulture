                <p>“After completing several maintenance visits for our client to undertake their seasonal maintenance we were approached to work on their front garden and design a new planting scheme. The brief was to try and create a feeling of a Mediterranean/ Cottage/Dry Gravel garden whilst being low maintenance.</p>

            <div class="cell small-12 medium-6 large-4">
                <p>After our initial site meeting the preferred colours to be used were identified as being Purples and Blues. The border was south facing and the client requested using gravel to reduce maintenance and create the desired effect. We kept a small selection of the existing plants that fitted in with the new theme and focused the display on being at its optimum during the late spring and summer months.”</p>
