                                <p>If this work isn’t carried out, over time plants may become unproductive, “woody” or “leggy”. They will use their energy to compete for light, space, water and nutrients and therefore won’t have the capacity to flower or perform for the purpose they were </p>

                                <h3>Can all plants be rejuvenated?</h3>
                                <p>No. Care must be taken to ensure the correct pruning methods are applied to the right plants. Not all shrubs or trees will respond well to this method and can result in the plant dying. There will also be occasions when the plant is simply beyond the point of rejuvenation and replacement is the only realistic option.</p>

                                <h3>Why do my plants need this attention?</h3>
                                <p>Plants are living organisms like us! They require certain basic elements to survive and be healthy. These consist of light, space, water, nutrients (food) and air. By removing one or more of these elements you are putting the plant under unnecessary stress and reducing the overall health of the plant.</p>

                                <h3>My plant looks worse than before!</h3>
                                <p>Most likely! This method of pruning is extreme and time consuming so therefore the difference from the start to the end of the job will also vary hugely. This may not always result in instant positive results! However, over a short period of time, the plant will show signs of benefiting from the additional light, space and air created with the addition of new growth.</p>

                        <p>I consider gardening as being a constantly evolving experiment. Plants have the ability to tell you when they are not doing well. A horticulturist will be able to read and understand these signs and act accordingly.</p>

                                    On rare occasions, I have committed and delivered planting schemes to clients that unfortunately take my plans and recommendations without me being rewarded with future work.

                                <p>Garden Centres are wonderful, inspirational places that entice! However, like supermarkets, they are commercial retail businesses. They will have strategically placed displays with colourful and scented plants to grab your attention and ultimately your money! However, what drew you to your new purchase at the time doesn’t guarantee continued success back at home.<br><br>
                                    Therefore, choosing the right plant for the right conditions is vital to success.</p>

                                    I like to think of buying a plant as an investment. How many other items do you purchase where once you get it home the value starts to increase? Not many!<br>
                                    By opting to spend a little money now before you purchase, you are vastly increasing your success rate in the garden and helping to protect your investment.</p>

This is to ensure they don’t outgrow their surroundings, reduces competition between neighbouring plants and encourages and stimulates new growth.</p>

                        <h3>What is plant rejuvenation pruning?</h3>
                        <p>Rejuvenation pruning is a method of pruning applied to trees and shrubs when either incorrect or irregular pruning has been applied over a sustained period of time. This method of pruning may initially appear drastic, extreme or unsightly. However, with the correct pruning methods applied, plants will respond positively to this work and often result in the equivalent to replacing old plants with new!</p>

                                <p>If this work isn’t carried out, over time plants may become unproductive, “woody” or “leggy”. They will use their energy to compete for light, space, water and nutrients and therefore won’t have the capacity to flower or perform for the purpose they were </p>

                                <h3>Can all plants be rejuvenated?</h3>
                                <p>No. Care must be taken to ensure the correct pruning methods are applied to the right plants. Not all shrubs or trees will respond well to this method and can result in the plant dying. There will also be occasions when the plant is simply beyond the point of rejuvenation and replacement is the only realistic option.</p>

                                <h3>Why do my plants need this attention?</h3>
                                <p>Plants are living organisms like us! They require certain basic elements to survive and be healthy. These consist of light, space, water, nutrients (food) and air. By removing one or more of these elements you are putting the plant under unnecessary stress and reducing the overall health of the plant.</p>

                                <p>Most likely! This method of pruning is extreme and time consuming so therefore the difference from the start to the end of the job will also vary hugely. This may not always result in instant positive results! However, over a short period of time, the plant will show signs of benefiting from the additional light, space and air created with the addition of new growth.</p>
