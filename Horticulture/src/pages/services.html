                                <p>Failure to complete this aftercare. may, over time, make your plant unproductive, “woody” and “leggy”. One common sign of this growth habit can be long, clear stems with growth only visible at the tips, limited flower and fruit production and reduced vigour. Therefore, the plant will focus its energy on sourcing light, space, water and nutrients and will therefore have limited surplus energy  to perform to its full potential.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="cell small-12 medium-6 minimized">
                                <h3>Can all plants be rejuvenated?<button><i class="fa fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></button></h3>
                                <p>No. Care must be taken to ensure the correct pruning methods are applied to the right plants. Not all herbaceous plants, shrubs and trees will respond to having this method applied which , in some circumstances, result in the plant dying. There will also be occasions when the plant is simply beyond the point of rejuvenation and therefore the only realistic option is replacement.</p>

                                <h3>Why do my plants need this attention?<button><i class="fa fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></button></h3>
                                <p>Plants require certain basic elements to survive and be resilient to pests and diseases. These consist of light, space, water, nutrients (food) and air. By removing one or more of these elements you are putting the plant under unnecessary stress thus reducing the overall health of the plant.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="cell small-12 medium-6 minimized">
                                <h3>My plant looks worse than ever!<button><i class="fa fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></button></h3>
                                <p>Quite likely! This method of pruning can be extreme resulting in minimal foliage and the plant size greatly reduced.  Flowering and fruiting may also be reduced in the following months and seasons. It can also be time consuming to apply  this method of pruning with varying degrees of recovery once completed. However, over time, the plant will start to show signs of benefiting from the additional light, space and air created with the addition of new growth with better fruiting and flower production.</p>

                        <h3>What is gardening to us?</h3>
                        <p>We consider gardening as being a constantly evolving experiment. Nature doesn’t stand still and its equally about personal preference as using correct techniques. We view one of the  key elements to successful gardening is to work with what you have and embrace the conditions not fight them. Plants have this wonderful ability to communicate with us. This may be in the form of letting us know when they are suffering from drought or over watering, nutrient deficiency, pests, diseases, incorrect pruning, lack of pruning, site conditions and soil type  A horticulturist will be able to read and understand these signs and act accordingly.</p>

                                <p>It is our belief that to provide a professional, targeted and tailored service we need to spend time either in your garden or working closes with you on your garden plans. This takes time and resources.<br>
                                    On rare occasions, we have committed researched and produced planting schemes to clients that unfortunately takeour plans and recommendations without S B Horticulture being rewarded any follow up work. Therefore,  we need to ensure we cover our resources while reassuring you  that we take your project seriously and give it the level of detail and commitment it deserves.</p>

                                <p>Garden Centres are wonderful, inspirational places that entice. They are a stage for show casing the best the season has to offer. However, like supermarkets, they are commercial retail businesses. They will have strategically placed displays with colourful and scented plants to grab your attention and ultimately your money! One of the common mistakes made in visiting a plant nursery or centre is to purchase what is in flower or drawn to purchasing it while its at its peak. In reality, what your buying is a plant that has been enjoyed by the retailer and therefore is likely you won’t get the full benefit or potential untl the following season. What drew you to your new purchase doesn’t guarantee continued success back at home in your garden.</p>

                                <p>It’s rare that it’s the wrong plant but more often the case of the wrong position.<br><br>
                                    Therefore, choosing the right plant for the right conditions is vital to success.<br>
                                    We like to think of buying a plant as an investment. If chosen correctly and given the correct conditions and aftercare your plant will continue to provide you with many years of enjoyment. There aren’t many commodities that have the potential to increase in time and maturity.<br>
                                    By opting to invest a little money now before you purchase, you are vastly increasing your success rate in the garden and helping to protect your investment.</p>

                <h4>Plant rejuvenation</h4>
                <p>The vast majority of plants require periodic pruning. This is best completed at least annually or more regularly depending on the plant, shrub or tree. This is to ensure they don’t outgrow their surroundings, reduces competition between neighbouring plants and encourages and stimulates new growth.</p>

                        <h3>What is plant rejuvenation pruning?</h3>
                        <p>Rejuvenation pruning is a method of pruning applied to trees and shrubs when either incorrect or irregular pruning has been applied over a sustained period of time. This method of pruning may initially appear drastic, extreme or unsightly. However, with the correct pruning methods applied, plants will respond positively to this work and often result in the equivalent to that of replacing an old plant with new with the added benefit of already having an established root system.</p>

                                <p>If pruning isn’t carried out periodically ,over time, plants may become unproductive, “woody” or “leggy”. The plant will instead divert there surplus energy to compete for light, space, water and nutrients. This may lead to reduced performance, vigour and overall health.</p>

                                <h3>Can all plants be rejuvenated?<button><i class="fa fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></button></h3>
                                <p>No. Care must be taken to ensure the correct pruning methods are applied to the right plants. Not all herbaceous, shrubs or trees will respond positively  to this method. This can have the opposite affect of that intended and can result in the plant dying. There will also be occasions when the plant is simply beyond the point of rejuvenation and replacement of the plant is the only realistic option.</p>

                                <h3>Why do my plants need this attention?<button><i class="fa fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i></button></h3>
                                <p>Plants, like us, require certain basic elements to survive and be healthy. These consist of light, space, water, nutrients (food) and air. By removing one or more of these elements you are putting the plant under unnecessary stress and reducing the overall health of the plant.</p>

                                <p>Most likely! This method of pruning is extreme and time consuming so therefore the difference from the start to the end of the job will also vary hugely. This may not always result in instantly positive results! However, over varying degrees of time, the plant will show signs of benefiting from this method of pruning with the added benefit of having a mature root system to respond positively to the work carried out.</p>
