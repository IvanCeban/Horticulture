        <h3>“I have known Simon Bradley for at least 10 years during which time he has provided garden maintenance services and general horticultural advice to me on a regular basis.  I have always found him to be extremely hard working, reliable and responsible.  He has good all-round knowledge and experience and has a network of other specialists he can call on if necessary.  He listens carefully to his brief but will also make recommendations if he thinks a better outcome is possible.  He works efficiently to a highstandard and I have referred him successfully to my neighbours.  I would have no hesitation in recommending him to others.”</h3>

        <h3>“We were very fortunate that Simon agreed to look at ‘sorting out our garden’. He came at a time that suited us and took us through what needed doing now and what should wait for the season to change. We needed a major overhaul but Simon took time to explain why we should keep some of the plants as they just needed careful pruning rather than replacement. He saved our Red Robin, which we thought was dead!When he worked, he was clean and tidy throughout and continued, even through torrential rain, to get the job done. He is thorough too, and even popped back to check the results of his labour. We were really pleased and will be getting him to come back for the spring tidy up, with confidence that he will get our garden ready for a beautiful year ahead. We would highly recommend Simon.”</h3>

        <h3>“We were originally approached by our client, Fiona Mcleod, back in the early summer of 2017. Fiona is a freelance garden photographer based in Buckinghamshire who photographs gardens and plants for magazine publications and pre-commissioned projects.<br><br>
            A large proportion of her garden was hard landscaped and planted around 10 years ago using mainly herbaceous perennials and ornamental grasses. Since then, further hard landscaping had taken place, creating additional borders. The project was planned for autumn 2017 and involved cutting back, lifting, dividing and replanting the existing plant stock blended with new additions due to the original borders becoming congested.<br><br>
            A planting plan and scope of works was designed and issued to us by Fiona to complete the project.<br><br>
            We worked closely with the client to ensure the work was completed as per her drawings and within the desired timeframe and were on site for several days undertaking the project.”</h3>

        <h3>“We were contacted by our client in the early spring of 2017. In the past the client had instructed several garden care providers to manage and maintain their extensive gardens with the most recent company being employed for approximately 8 years.<br><br>
            During this period, there had been several areas where the planting had been added to and amended. We were invited to discuss and review the planting with the client as they felt the garden lacked seasonal interest, colour, and plant variety. The brief was to ensure the garden reflected the seasons with interest throughout the year.<br><br>
            Our initial advice and recommendation to the client was to agree which plants to retain, those that were in need of rejuvenation, those that would benefit from relocation and those to remove.<br><br>
            We then designed, and worked systematically, through the garden creating opportunities to inject colour and seasonal interest that would reflect the time of year whilst creating focal points around the garden. This work included the preparation and enrichment of the soil, pruning, dividing, relocating and incorporating new plants.<br><br>
            On completion of the project, we were approached by the client to undertake their year round maintenance and attend fortnightly to manage the garden going forward. ”</h3>
